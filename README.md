# University Soccer Team's Performance Analytics Project 📊⚽

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis solution for tracking and evaluating the university's soccer team performance over three competitive seasons (2021-2023). By leveraging advanced SQL techniques and detailed performance metrics, we offer deep insights into team dynamics, match strategies, and player contributions.

## 🎯 Core Analysis Objectives

Our project focuses on four critical performance analysis domains:

1. **Penalty Conversion Rates**
   - Precise tracking of penalty kick performance
   - Statistical analysis of conversion success rates

2. **Home vs. Away Performance Analysis**
   - Comparative evaluation of team performance across different venues
   - Identifying home-field advantages and away-game challenges

3. **First-Half vs. Second-Half Performance**
   - Detailed comparison of team efficiency across match halves
   - Identifying patterns of momentum and strategic adjustments

4. **Opponent Statistics Breakdown**
   - Comprehensive analysis of performance against different opponents
   - Tactical insights based on opponent-specific data
